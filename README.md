# Mini-Project: A Data-driven Approach to Predicting University Student Retention

Student dropout is a persistent challenge in higher education, carrying significant social and economic consequences for both individuals and institutions. This project introduces a data-driven framework for predicting student retention and dropout risk, leveraging advanced machine learning models on a comprehensive dataset that includes academic performance, demographic information, and socioeconomic background. Rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation were conducted, with Random Forest and XGBoost emerging as the top performers. Academic achievement, financial status, and parental background were identified as the most influential predictors. The final model was deployed as an interactive web application, providing educators and administrators with actionable insights to identify at-risk students early and support targeted interventions. By enabling timely and evidence-based decision-making, this work directly supports Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) by promoting inclusive and equitable quality education and fostering student success. Despite strong results, challenges such as class imbalance and the absence of behavioral data remain. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of predictive analytics to drive educational improvement and offers a scalable, reproducible solution adaptable to diverse institutional settings.
